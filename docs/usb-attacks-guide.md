# Understanding USB-Based Attacks

## Overview

USB-based attacks exploit the inherent trust relationship between users and USB devices. This document provides educational insight into how these attacks work and how to defend against them.

## Common USB Attack Vectors

### 1. BadUSB Attacks

**What it is:** Malicious firmware that reprograms USB devices to act as different device types (e.g., a USB drive that also functions as a keyboard).

**How it works:**
- Device presents itself as a trusted USB storage device
- Simultaneously registers as a Human Interface Device (HID) like a keyboard
- Executes keystrokes to run malicious commands
- Can bypass traditional antivirus detection

**Educational Example:**
```python
# Simulated HID injection (educational purposes)
def simulate_keystroke_injection():
    """
    This demonstrates how a BadUSB device might inject keystrokes
    In reality, this would use USB HID protocols
    """
    keystrokes = [
        "Win+R",           # Open Run dialog
        "powershell",      # Launch PowerShell
        "Enter",           # Execute
        "malicious_command" # Execute malicious payload
    ]
    return keystrokes
```

### 2. USB Drop Attacks

**What it is:** Physical deployment of malicious USB devices in areas where targets might find and use them.

**How it works:**
- Attacker leaves specially crafted USB devices in parking lots, lobbies, etc.
- Curious users plug the device into their computers
- Device automatically executes malicious payloads
- Can lead to network compromise, data theft, or malware installation

**Defense Strategies:**
- Never plug in unknown USB devices
- Use USB blocking software
- Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Security awareness training

### 3. Juice Jacking

**What it is:** Compromised USB charging stations that can access device data.

**How it works:**
- Public charging stations modified with malicious hardware
- When devices connect for charging, data pins are also accessible
- Can install malware, steal data, or perform surveillance
- Particularly effective against mobile devices

**Defense Strategies:**
- Use power-only USB cables
- Carry portable battery packs
- Use USB data blockers
- Avoid public charging stations when possible

## Technical Deep Dive

### USB Protocol Basics

USB devices communicate through several key components:

1. **Device Descriptors:** Define device capabilities and interface types
2. **Endpoints:** Communication channels for data transfer
3. **Interface Classes:** Standard device types (HID, Mass Storage, etc.)

### HID (Human Interface Device) Class

HID devices include keyboards, mice, and other input devices:

```python
# Example HID descriptor structure (educational)
class HIDDescriptor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bLength = 9
        self.bDescriptorType = 0x21  # HID
        self.bcdHID = 0x0111         # HID version 1.11
        self.bCountryCode = 0        # Not country specific
        self.bNumDescriptors = 1     # One report descriptor
```

### Mass Storage Class

Mass storage devices like USB drives:

```python
# Example mass storage operations (educational)
class MassStorageDevice:
    def __init__(self):
        self.device_type = "USB_MASS_STORAGE"
        self.capacity = "2GB"
        
    def present_as_drive(self):
        """Device appears as normal USB drive"""
        return "TRUSTED_DRIVE"
    
    def autorun_payload(self):
        """Potential autorun execution"""
        return "autorun.inf execution"
```

## Real-World Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Corporate Espionage

**Setup:**
- Attacker creates USB device disguised as company-branded merchandise
- Device left in employee parking lot or break room
- Contains corporate logos and appears legitimate

**Execution:**
1. Employee finds and connects device
2. Device registers as both storage and keyboard
3. Injects PowerShell commands to:
   - Disable Windows Defender
   - Download and execute remote access tool (RAT)
   - Establish persistent backdoor
   - Exfiltrate sensitive documents

**Impact:**
- Complete network compromise
- Intellectual property theft
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Financial losses

### Scenario 2: Credential Harvesting

**Setup:**
- USB device programmed to extract browser credentials
- Disguised as legitimate software installer or document

**Execution:**
1. Device mounts as storage with "important_document.exe"
2. Simultaneously injects keystrokes to run hidden payload
3. Payload extracts:
   - Saved passwords from browsers
   - Cryptocurrency wallets
   - SSH keys and certificates
   - Email credentials

**Impact:**
- Account takeovers
- Financial theft
- Identity theft
- Further lateral movement in networks

## Defensive Strategies

### Technical Controls

#### 1. USB Port Management
```bash
# Disable USB ports via Group Policy (Windows)
# Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Device Installation
# Device Installation Restrictions

# Linux udev rules to block USB storage
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{bDeviceClass}=="08", RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo 1 >/sys\$devpath/remove'"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-block-usb-storage.rules
```

#### 2. Application Whitelisting
```powershell
# Windows AppLocker example
New-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Executable -User Everyone -Action Allow -Path "C:\Program Files\*"
New-AppLockerPolicy -RuleType Executable -User Everyone -Action Deny -Path "*"
```

#### 3. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Monitor for unusual process creation from removable media
- Detect suspicious PowerShell execution
- Alert on credential access attempts
- Network behavioral analysis

### Physical Controls

1. **USB Port Locks:** Physical barriers preventing device insertion
2. **Surveillance:** Monitor areas where USB drops might occur
3. **Access Controls:** Restrict physical access to workstations
4. **Clean Desk Policy:** Reduce opportunities for physical attacks

### Administrative Controls

1. **Security Awareness Training:**
   - Regular phishing and USB drop simulations
   - Education about USB-based threats
   - Clear incident reporting procedures
   - Recognition and rewards for proper security behavior

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Legal Framework

USB-based attacks may violate numerous laws:

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US):** Unauthorized access to protected computers
- **Data Protection Regulations (EU/UK):** Unauthorized processing of personal data
- **Cybercrime Laws:** Vary by jurisdiction but generally prohibit unauthorized access

### Ethical Guidelines

When conducting educational or authorized testing:

1. **Obtain explicit written permission** before testing
2. **Limit scope** to authorized systems and data
3. **Document all activities** for transparency
4. **Secure all collected data** and delete when no longer needed
5. **Report findings responsibly** through proper channels

### Professional Standards

Follow industry frameworks:
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **OWASP Testing Guide**
- **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**
- **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**

## Advanced Topics

### USB-C and Thunderbolt Attacks

Modern USB-C and Thunderbolt interfaces introduce new attack vectors:

- **Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks**
- **PCIe enumeration attacks**
- **Power delivery manipulation**

### Mobile Device Considerations

Smartphones and tablets present unique challenges:

- **USB debugging mode exploitation**
- **Mobile device management (MDM) bypass**
- **iOS/Android-specific attack vectors**

### IoT and Embedded Systems

Internet of Things devices often lack proper USB security:

- **Firmware extraction via USB**
- **Debug interface access**
- **Serial console exploitation**

## Conclusion

USB-based attacks represent a significant security threat due to the ubiquitous nature of USB devices and the inherent trust users place in them. Understanding these attack vectors, implementing appropriate defenses, and maintaining security awareness are crucial for protecting against these threats.

The educational value of studying USB attacks lies not in learning to exploit systems, but in developing a deeper understanding of attack methodologies to build more effective defenses. As security professionals, our goal is to stay ahead of threats through continuous learning and improvement of security practices.

Remember: Knowledge of attack techniques should always be used to improve defensive capabilities and protect systems, never to cause harm or unauthorized access.
