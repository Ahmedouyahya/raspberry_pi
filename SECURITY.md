## üìä Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels based on CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) guidelines:

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Allows arbitrary code execution with system privileges
- Complete system compromise
- Mass data extraction without authentication

**Response Time**: Immediate (within 24 hours)

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Allows unauthorized access to sensitive data
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Bypass of critical security controls

**Response Time**: Within 72 hours

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited information disclosure
- Denial of service vulnerabilities
- Moderate impact security bypasses

**Response Time**: Within 1 week

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information disclosure
- Limited impact vulnerabilities
- Best practice improvements

**Response Time**: Within 2 weeks
